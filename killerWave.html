  <div class="projectDescription">
    <p>This is game submited for a <a href="https://itch.io/jam/brackeys-5">Brackeys Game Jam 2021</a>. This two-players game was developed in a week.</p>
    <p>Playable at https://fenx93.github.io/CSC3224Game/. Recommend using fullscreen.</p>
    <p>This is a two-players game that focuses the idea “Strong Together”. As name suggests, when being relatively close to each other the players create a line that can damage and destroy enemies. </p>
    <p>Initially it had “<a href="https://github.com/staffantan/unity-vhsglitch">VHS Glitch</a>” effect which looked cool, but was a bit too distracting.</p>
    <p>Soundtrack was created by my friend William Wiazinin.</p>
