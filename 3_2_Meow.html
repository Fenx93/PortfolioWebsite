        <p>Initially this was planned as a small indie game project to be developed in month or two that would be my first shipped title.</p>
        <p>As always, game specification was evolving along with the development, so the initial deadlines weren't met.</p>
        <p>At the moment, implementation is completed, testing is carried on, release materials, such as trailer are in progress.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Basically, this is a bit more complicated rock-paper-scissors game.</p>
        <p>At the moment, there are 5 classes to choose from with unique mechanics and abilities.</p>

        <p>I have developed an automatic inventory system that creates required tabs and fills them with various items.</p>

      <div class="drop-content">
        <p>I wasn't aware that Unity dev team have finally released their Localisation System, so I have created my own.</p>
        <p>It has turned out to be a good decision, since besides gaining additional experience it allowed me to easily share my localisation files with firends who were doing translations and it was easier to understand and implement.</p>

      <div class="drop-content">
        <p>One of the reasons I have started this project was learning how Android games, Play Store and its services work.</p>
        <p>That was one of the hardest and time consuming tasks for this project, but I have gained loads of experience on developing, building, debugging, publishing Android applications.</p>
        <p>Additionally, gained an understanding of Play Store - certificates, testing and release phases, configuration.</p>
        <p>Finally, I have managed to integrate Play Services such as cloud saving, advertisements and purchases.</p>
